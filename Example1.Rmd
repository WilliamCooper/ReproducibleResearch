## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple
formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and 
MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown 
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

In RStudio, click the **Knit** button to generate
a document that includes both content as well as the 
output of any embedded R code chunks within the 
document. From R, use *rmarkdown::render(path_to_file)*.

Here are some more examples of how to use the R Markdown formatting conventions:

### Headers

The number of "#" signs sets the level of the header; here, 3rd level.

### Lists

Bullets:  

* first  [text is "\* first"]
* second  [text is "\* second"]
    + second item, first subitem [text is "+ second item ..."]  
    
Numbered list:  

1. First item [text is "1. First item"]
2. Second Item
    + first subitem of second item

### Format Options:

* **bold** [text is "\*\*bold\*\*"]
* *italic* [text is "*italic*"]
* superscript: a^2^; subscript: a~2~. [typed "a\^2\^ and a\~2\~]
* horizontal rule: ***  [entered on a separate line]

***
* links: https://www.eol.ucar.edu or [EOL](https://www.eol.ucar.edu)
    + (the second form links to the same site but the address is not visible. 
    It is entered as follows:  
    ```
    [EOL](https://www.eol.ucar.edu)
    ```
* By default, lines are joined together into continuous paragraphs. To force a 
line break: add two spaces at the end of a line, like this:  
first line  
second line  

* images: 
```
"![caption](path_to_figure){width=50%}"
```
