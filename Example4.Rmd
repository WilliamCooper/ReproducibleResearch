```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Specify the url
# For tomorrow's forecast: (d1 is today; d3 day-after-tomorrow)
img.pdf <- './noaad2.pdf'
img.png <- sub('pdf', 'png', img.pdf)
url <- sprintf ("https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/noaa/%s", img.pdf)
# system(sprintf('wget -r %s', url))  ## an alternative to next line
curl::curl_download(url, img.pdf)
```



## Tomorrow's Forecast Map

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width=640}
scmd <- sprintf ('convert -density 1280 %s %s', img.pdf, img.png)
system(scmd)  ## Instead, could have used a "bash" chunk to do this. "system()" 
              ## waits for the command to finish.
knitr::include_graphics(img.png)
```

I like to put something like this is a cron job to download each morning, so
that the plot is waiting in my personal web server. Other pages can show
the local forecast, satellite image, etc.

## Using Figures Generated Externally

Unless you include sufficient information to support duplication of the
figure, this can pose problems for reproducibility. However, sometimes it
is necessary. Here is an example that uses the EOL/RAF program "ncplot"
to generate a figure and include it in the document. The code chunk here
uses the "bash" shell to run ncplot with appropriate arguments including
a template that defines the plot. The first time, this chunk was executed
with "eval = TRUE" and the figure that was generated was saved as "ncplot.png".
Subsequent runs then use "eval = FALSE" to skip the interaction with the user.
This call provides details regarding how the plot was generated, although it
requires two runs and manual saving of the plot with a specified name. The
template used to generate plots like this (here, named "ncplotTemplate") 
can then be saved with the project
archive. Of course, regular users of ncplot will know how to reconstruct
this plot by looking at it, but this documentation better defines its 
construction for someone not familiar with it.

```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
<!-- arguments here specify the template (-s) and time interval (-t) -->
ncplot /scr/raf_data/SOCRATES/SOCRATESrf15.nc -s ncplotTemplate -t 5:07:00-5:17:00
```

![](ncplot.png){width=640px}

(Discuss the plot here: For a
specific time interval, it shows two different temperature sensors that
are in reasonable agreement.)

Here is what is contained in "ncplotTemplate":

```
ncplot template file
Version=4
PlotType=0
nPanels=1
Grid=0, AutoScale=1, AutoTics=1
Yaxis - Invert=0 0, log=0 0, bounds=-6.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00, xTics=5 2, yTics=8 2
nSets=2
VarName=ATF1 Panel#=0, ScaleLoc=0
VarName=ATH1 Panel#=0, ScaleLoc=0
xLabel0=UTC
yLabel0L=Â°C
yLabel0R=

```
With that information, it will be possible for someone else to duplicate the plot.
